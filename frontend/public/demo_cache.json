  "text": "I understand how stressful dental costs can be, especially on a fixed income. The good news is there are **several programs in Kingston** that can help you get affordable dental care.\n\nHere's what I found for you:\n\n**1. Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (OSDCP)**\nThis is a provincial program specifically for Ontario seniors aged 65+ with an annual income under $22,200 (single) or $37,100 (couple). It covers a wide range of dental services including checkups, cleanings, fillings, extractions, and dentures — all at no cost to you.\n\n**2. Kingston Community Health Centres (KCHC)**\nThe KCHC offers dental services on a sliding scale based on your income. They are very welcoming to seniors and can often see you sooner than other options.\n\n**3. KFL&A Public Health Dental Programs**\nPublic Health also runs dental clinics for low-income residents. You may qualify for free preventive and basic dental care through their programs.\n\nI've put together an action plan below with the steps to get started. The most important first step is calling the Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program — they can often get you enrolled within a couple of weeks.",
