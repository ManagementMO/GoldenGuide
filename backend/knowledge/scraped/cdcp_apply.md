## When you can apply
**Applications are open**
All eligible Canadians can now apply for the Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP).
You must meet all 4 of the [eligibility requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/dental/dental-care-plan/qualify.html) before applying.
## Apply online
### What you need to apply
You’ll need to provide the following information for each applicant, and your spouse or common-law partner (if you have one):
* Social Insurance Number (SIN) (if available for children)
* date of birth
* full name
* home and mailing address
* list of dental coverage through government social programs (if applicable)
* you and your spouse or common-law partner (if applicable) must have filed your tax return in Canada for the previous year and have received your notice of assessment
### If you are ready to apply or if your previous coverage has expired
#### Use My Service Canada Account (MSCA)
Steps to apply:
1. Sign in or create your My Service Canada Account (MSCA) using the first button below.
2. The Canadian Dental Care Plan is shown at the top of the page on your MSCA dashboard.
3. Click on "Apply for the Canadian Dental Care Plan" and follow the instructions.
[Apply via MSCA](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html)
#### If you can't use MSCA
[Apply via canada.ca](https://srv024.service.canada.ca/en/apply/)
#### If you can't use MSCA or canada.ca
Call Service Canada at 1-833-537-4342. For TTY, call 1-833-677-6262.
#### When applying
Select "digital" as your communications preference to receive email notifications. You can also access letters from the CDCP through MSCA. By signing up, you'll get important updates in one place, and it is faster than waiting for letters in the mail.
#### Renewing your yearly coverage
You will need to renew your coverage to the CDCP every year to confirm that you still meet the eligibility requirements. The renewal process for the 2025 to 2026 benefit coverage period has ended.
If you didn't renew and your CDCP coverage ended on June 30, 2025, you can submit a new application. There will be a gap in your coverage until it is reinstated. Oral health care services received during this gap will not be covered nor reimbursed retroactively.
You should always confirm that your CDCP coverage is active before seeking treatment from your oral health provider. Please note that your co-payment level could change when you renew. Any preauthorized treatments will be paid at the [co-payment level](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/dental/dental-care-plan/coverage.html#co-payments) at the time of treatment.
## If someone is helping you apply
You can ask someone you trust or a delegate to help you apply for the CDCP.
* Applying with the help of someone you trust
You can ask a trusted person to help you apply by phone. This could be a:
* friend
* relative
* caregiver
* translator, or
* interpreter
You must be able to give clear consent that you agree to let them help you.
* Applying through a delegate
A delegate is someone who has the legal authority to represent you and make decisions on your behalf.
They can represent you if they’re listed as your delegate on documents such as:
* power of attorney
* mandate
* trusteeship
Before you apply, your delegate must prove that they have the legal authority to represent you. The documents listed above are considered proof. Mail original documents or certified copies to us, or bring them in person to any Service Canada office (see mailing addresses by region).
Once we’ve processed the documents, we’ll contact your delegate to confirm that we’ve accepted and added the documents to your file. Your delegate can then apply to the CDCP on your behalf.
#### How to submit your proof of delegate documents
##### By mail
If you or your delegate are sending us the documents by mail, please **include a cover letter** with:
* your full name
* your Social Insurance Number (SIN)
* a statement that the documents are being submitted for the CDCP
* your delegate’s phone number and
* a return address, so we can return your documents for us to send the original documents or certified copies back to once we’ve processed them
