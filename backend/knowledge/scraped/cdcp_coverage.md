For more information on services covered, consult the[CDCP Dental Benefits Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/dental/dental-care-plan/guide.html) and the [CDCP Dental Benefit Grids](https://www.sunlife.ca/sl/cdcp/en/provider/dental-benefit-grids/)
**Note:** Some services including those beyond established frequency limits require preauthorization by the CDCP. This means your provider will recommend services and the CDCP will confirm whether they will be covered by the plan. This pre-approval must happen before you can receive these services. The decision will take into consideration your oral health history and medical conditions. Not all requests will be approved for coverage. You may still decide to proceed with the services proposed by your provider, even if not covered by the plan and pay for these directly to your provider.
## How much will be covered
The CDCP will reimburse a portion of the cost of your treatment, but it may not pay the full amount. You may have to pay additional charges directly to the oral health provider, if:
* your adjusted family net income is between $70,000 and $89,999
* the cost of your oral health care services is more than what the CDCP will reimburse for these services, or
* you and your oral health provider agree to services that the CDCP doesn’t cover
### Reimbursement for services
Only oral health providers get reimbursed for services covered under the CDCP.
If you are covered by the CDCP, you shouldn’t pay the full cost upfront, but you may have to pay any additional charges directly to the oral health provider.
Please [contact us](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/dental/dental-care-plan/contact.html) if you have questions or require support.
### Co-payments
You may have a co-payment based on your adjusted family net income. A co-payment is the percentage of the CDCP fees that isn’t covered by the CDCP, and that you will have to pay directly to the oral health provider. Your co-payment is based on your adjusted family net income.
**Co-payments based on adjusted family net income**|Adjusted family net income|How much will the CDCP cover|How much you will cover|
|Lower than $70,000|100% of eligible oral health care service costs will be covered at the CDCP established fees.|0% of the CDCP established fees. You may face additional charges as described below.|

### Additional charges
The CDCP fees may not be the same as what providers charge. You may have to pay fees in addition to the potential co-payment if:
* the cost of your oral health care services is more than what the CDCP will reimburse for these services
* you and your oral health provider agree to services that the CDCP doesn’t cover
Before receiving oral health care, you should always ask your oral health provider about any costs that won’t be covered by the plan. Make sure you know what you’ll have to pay directly to your oral health provider before accepting and receiving treatment.
