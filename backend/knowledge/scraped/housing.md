## Affordable Housing Listing

The Affordable Housing Listing includes properties that have received government funding to keep rents affordable over the long term. Affordable rents are set at below-market levels. For availability, please contact the individual landlords directly. Note that these units are different from rent-geared-to-income housing. If you are looking for rent-geared-to-income options, please visit ourSocial Housing webpage.
We provide the affordable housing listing for informational purposes only.
