## Services provided

We offer different programs that support low- and moderate-income households. You only need to apply once to MFAP to access the discounts. We provide funding on a first-come, first-served basis until we reach the yearly budget.
Affordable recreation
The Subsidy Program for Affordable Recreation in Kingston (SPARK) helps reduce the cost of our recreation programs for Kingston residents.
SPARK provides free access to our:
- Fitness centres
- Arenas for public skate
- Pools for public swims
- Culligan Water Park
Each eligible family member can also receive up to $300 every year to put toward recreation and leisure programs. Learn more about theAffordable Recreation Program.
Due to the popularity of SPARK, the total program funds for 2025 have now been fully expended. SPARK funding is no longer available for the remainder of the 2025 calendar year.Your one-year SPARK Fit Pass membership remains valid and can continue to be used as usual.
