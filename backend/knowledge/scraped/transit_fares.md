## Transfers
To get a transfer, pay your fare with coins and request one from the bus operator. Your transfer gives you 90 minutes of unlimited travel.
When you use your smart card or a disposable ticket, transfers are automatically added to your trip.
Monthly and Affordable Monthly Passes have unlimited transfers.
Once your transfer expires, you will need to pay a new fare. If you experience a problem, pay your fare and contact Customer Service at [613-546-0000](tel:613-546-0000). You will be asked to provide the four-digit bus number, date, and time the issue occurred.
**Important:** Transfers can only be used by the customer that they are issued to.
