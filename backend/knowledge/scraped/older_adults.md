Older Adult Services | City of Kingston
# Older Adult Services
In Kingston, about 21 per cent of our population is 65 or older. This number has steadily been growing over the last 20 years. We are currently seeing a record number of the working age population entering retirement as the population over 65 continues to grow!
## Age-friendly communities
In recent years, Kingston has been working to make the city more welcoming for older adults as part of the ‘age-friendly’ initiative by the World Health Organization. In 2015, we asked adults (45 and up) about things like activities, safety, health and how friendly they found the city for older adults.
During these efforts, older adults told us four main things:
*
* They want to keep living in their own homes
* They want to be part of the Kingston community and do things
* They want to know where to find help when they need it
* They want people to treat them with respect
## Programs to help you at home
Staying in your home programs means you can save on taxes, get assistance with household tasks and receive help from your neighbours and local community.
### Older adults tax assistance programs
We offer tax assistance programs to help with taxes for older adults, especially when they retire and their finances change. This ensures they follow tax rules and get the support they require. Learn more about application requirements on our [tax assistance and rebates page](https://www.cityofkingston.ca/property-taxes/tax-assistance-and-rebates/).

* **Senior Property Tax Credit program:** Older adults getting the Guaranteed Income Supplement can get a $100 tax credit
* **Tax deferral program:** Older adults who own a home and get the Guaranteed Income Supplement can defer paying up to $1,000 in taxes
