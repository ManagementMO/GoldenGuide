# Older Adult Services

In Kingston, about 21 per cent of our population is 65 or older. This number has steadily been growing over the last 20 years. We are currently seeing a record number of the working age population entering retirement as the population over 65 continues to grow!

## Age-friendly communities

In recent years, Kingston has been working to make the city more welcoming for older adults as part of the ‘age-friendly’ initiative by the World Health Organization. In 2015, we asked adults (45 and up) about things like activities, safety, health and how friendly they found the city for older adults.
During these efforts, older adults told us four main things:
- They want to keep living in their own homesThey want to be part of the Kingston community and do thingsThey want to know where to find help when they need itThey want people to treat them with respect
