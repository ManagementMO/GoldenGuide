It helps people who currently rent a place and want to buy a home in Kingston or Frontenac County by offering a forgivable loan for the down payment.\nYou might qualify for this program if you are currently renting housing or are a first-time buyer, and would like to buy a home priced at $500,000 or less in the City of Kingston or the County of Frontenac.\n**Household eligibility criteria:**\n* ****The household must currently live within the city of Kingston or Frontenac County.

A one-person household is a household with one income earner who would be the sole property owner (exclusive of dependent household members).\n* The total gross income for a two-person household cannot exceed $130,000. A two-person household is a household with two income earners who contribute to the finances of the household (exclusive of dependents household members).\n* Previous program homebuyers are ineligible\n* The household must buy their principal residence\n* Household members must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents\n* The application must include a mortgage pre-approval from a lending institution, eligible lenders include banks, credit unitions, and mortgage investment corporations.

It provides lower-cost rental units or a housing allowance to households with low-to-moderate incomes. Social housing is governed by the [Housing Services Act, 2011](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/11h06). All providers are requested to comply with the [Social Housing Directives](https://www.cityofkingston.ca/community-supports/housing-and-homelessness/social-housing/social-housing-directives/).\n* Rent-Geared-to Income Housing\nThe programs offered are based on the household income and assets. A household is defined as all people who will be living in the same unit.\n## Rent-geared-to-income (RGI) program\nRGI means that the rent you pay for housing is based on your income. Generally, RGI rent is calculated at 30 percent of a household’s income. This is based on each household member's Notice of Assessment (annual income tax return). If your only source of income is Ontario Works (OW) or Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), the rent is based on a rent scale set by the Ontario Government.\nA PHB is a monthly subsidy for low-income households to help with housing costs. It provides eligible households with a monthly payment to help with rental costs in the private rental market. The benefit belongs to the individual and can be used to help pay rent anywhere in Kingston or the County of Frontenac, even if you move.\nUnlike RGI assistance, this benefit is linked to the household, not a specific place. It lets the household move to any rental unit in the City of Kingston or the County of Frontenac. This gives recipients the flexibility to live closer to family, support networks, schools, or work.\nHouseholds must already pay rent in their current unit or find their own private rental market housing in the City of Kingston or the County of Frontenac.\nThe monthly benefit is calculated using your household’s adjusted family net income (AFNI) as reported on your annual Notice of Assessment Line 23600. It is also based on the amount of rent you pay, and the Average Market Rent (AMR) assessed by the Ontario government for Kingston.\nIf you are single and in receipt of ODSP and your AFNI = $16,056, your ODSP shelter allowance is $599, and your rent is $1,700. You are eligible for a 1 bedroom which as an AMR of $1,409.\n1. New applicants start by filling out a Rent-Geared-to-Income Application with the Housing Registry (the Registry). If something is missing or incomplete with the application, you will be notified within 7 business days. If we do not receive the information or have not been contacted by you, we will cancel the application after 90 days (about 3 months).\n2. If your application is complete, you will be notified within 30 days (about a month) to let you know if you are eligible or not. If you are eligible, your name will be placed on the centralized waitlist (CWL), and you will be assigned to a Community Programs Caseworker who will be your worker for the duration you are waiting for an RGI unit or a PHB\n* The size of unit you qualify for.\nPlease note, these are averages. Some households have been waiting for longer than 14 years to be housed due to the factors listed above.\nThe only households who get faster access to housing in Kingston and Frontenac County are those who have been granted Special Priority Status. In 2023, the average wait time was 6 months for Special Priority applicants.\nEligibility requirements for RGI and PHB\n* At least one member of the household must be 16 years of age or older and be able to live independently without support services or can arrange their own support.\n* Each member of the household must be a Canadian Citizen, a Permanent Resident of Canada, a Refugee Claimant, or has made an application to become a Permanent Resident.\n* No member of the household owes money to any social housing provider in Ontario. You can apply if there is a repayment agreement which is in good standing.\n* No household member has been convicted of misrepresenting their income to receive RGI assistance in the past 2 years.\n* If any member of your household owns residential property suitable for year-round occupancy, they must agree to sell the property within 6 months of moving into RGI housing or receiving a PHB.\n* Your total household income must be under the household income limits, depending upon your eligible unit size.
